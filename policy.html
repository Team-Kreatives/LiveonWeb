            <p>
                We consider protecting the security of your personal information as very important. When you enter
                personal
                information on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer
                technology (sometimes referred to as "SSL").
            </p>

            <p>
                We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information submitted to us, both
                during
                transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
                electronic
                storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
                personal information, we do not guarantee absolute security. We are not responsible for the unauthorized
                acts of others and we assume no liability for any disclosure of information due to errors in
                transmission,
                unauthorized third party access (such as through hacking) or other acts of third parties, or acts or
                omissions beyond our reasonable control.
